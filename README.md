# Gamergirls-Dresses
Gamergirls was a fashion technology project for Makefashion in 2016 by Phi : Illuminated Design. 
A mobile app provides controls for each game played out on custom made LED panels on the fronts of the garments.
Communication to and from the app is provided by a Bluetooth transceiver.
